The ADT Map is a data structure that stores (key, value) pairs using a hash table with open addressing to resolve collisions. It employs quadratic probing, meaning that when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available position using a quadratic function. This method helps reduce clustering and improves efficiency compared to linear probing. Insertions, deletions, and searches are performed in average-case O(1) time, but may degrade to O(n) in the worst case. The map dynamically resizes when needed to maintain an efficient load factor and ensure optimal performance.
